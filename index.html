  <h1>Alternate PyBank and PyPoll Solutions</h1>

  <p>The three Pybank solutions demonstrate good coding practices <br>
     for comments and clarity. They also show the difference between an <br>
     <em>iterat<strong>ive</strong></em> one-at-a_time style vs. an  <br>
     <em>iterat<strong>or</strong></em> do-it-all-at-once style.</p>
       
  <br>       

  <p>The PyPoll solution uses a dictionary rather than a list to show <br>
     why dictionaries are often the preferred data structure as well <br>
     as introducing students to the idiomatic or 'Pythonic' philosophy of <br>
     coding.</p>
